# MachineLearningPartOne-ClimateWins
Using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change for fictional company ClimateWins based in Europe.

This is a project designed to challenge the junior data analyst by introducing machine learning skills in Python. The project mimics a fictional nonprofit organization (CliamteWins) with limited funding that does not have a data scientist or data engineer team. Working as a junior data analyst enter this challenged as a data analyst, trainee, data scientist and researcher all at once to achieve ClimateWins goals.
This project contains supervised learning models including:
  1) Steps to scale data to make it easier to use in machine learning models.
  2) Gradient Descent
  3) Multiple Confusion Matrices
  4) K-Nearest Neighbor models
  5) Decision Tree models
  6) Artificial Neural Network models
